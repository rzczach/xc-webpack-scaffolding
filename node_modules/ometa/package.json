  "readme": "# OMeta/JS\n\nOMeta/JS is a JavaScript implementation of OMeta\n\n## Main Repository\n\nThis repository is a forked version of the original intended to\nprovide an api to node.js and also a package for npm. Questions\nabout the core should be directed to the original author, Alessandro\nWarth.\n\n## Original README\n\nThe following files contain some important info:\n\n* Not_Quite_JS.txt explains the difference between \"real\" JavaScript and\n  the JavaScript that can be used in the OMeta/JS Workspace.\n\n* Things_You_Should_Know.txt explains the differences between the original\n  OMeta syntax (as it appeared in the DLS'07 paper) and the newer OMeta/js\n  syntax.\n\n* OMeta_Tutorial.txt contains a bunch of examples that show how OMeta\n  can be used for pattern matching, parsing, etc.\n\nAnother good resource for OMeta programmers is the OMeta mailing list. To\nsubscribe, please visit:\n\n    http://vpri.org/mailman/listinfo/ometa\n\nAnd you can also browse the archives of the mailing list at:\n\n    http://vpri.org/pipermail/ometa/\n\nCheers,\nAlex \n\n## MIT and Modified MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 Brian Mavity \n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nExcept as contained in this notice, the name(s) of the above copyright\nholders shall not be used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale,\nuse or other dealings in this Software without prior written authorization.\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
